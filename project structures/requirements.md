# approach for developing the RSVP service

1. [x]**User Authentication and Registration:**
   - Implement user authentication system allowing users to register and log in using email/password or social accounts like Google.
   - Only event organizers should be able to create events, so ensure that event creation functionality is accessible only to registered users.

2. [x]**Event Creation:**
   - Create a form for event organizers to input event details such as name, date & time, location, and event image.
   - Validate the input to ensure all required fields are filled.
   - Allow event organizers to share the event link with their friends.

3. [x]**RSVP Functionality:**
   - Design a form for guests to RSVP, including fields for name, email, attending status, and number of additional guests.
   - Implement logic to send confirmation emails to guests who indicate they are attending, containing event details like location.
   - Ensure that only attending guests receive the event location.

4. [x]**Event Organizer Dashboard:**
   - Develop a dashboard for event organizers to view RSVP responses, including guest names, plus-ones, and total number of confirmed guests.
   - Include options for event organizers to manage congratulatory messages, display/hide guest list, total guest count, and create a list of items for guests to bring.

5. [x]**Congratulatory Messages:**
   - Implement functionality for attending guests to send congratulatory messages during RSVP.
   - Allow event organizers to manage these messages and choose which ones to display on the event page.

6. **Optional Features:**
   - Allow event organizers to create a list of items for guests to bring and display this list during RSVP.
   - Implement features to display or hide guest list and total guest count based on organizer preferences.

7. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Choose appropriate technologies for backend development (e.g., Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails) and frontend development (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
   - Utilize a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user data, event details, and RSVP responses.
   - Implement secure APIs for communication between the frontend and backend components.

8. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features work as expected and address any bugs or issues.
   - Deploy the application on a reliable hosting platform, ensuring scalability and security considerations are addressed.

9. **User Experience and Design:**
   - Design a user-friendly interface for both event organizers and guests, focusing on ease of navigation and clear communication of event details.
   - Ensure responsiveness across different devices to provide a seamless experience for all users.

10. **Feedback and Iteration:**
    - Gather feedback from users during and after the initial launch to identify areas for improvement.
    - Iterate on the application based on user feedback and evolving business requirements.

By following these steps, you can build an RSVP service that meets the business requirements of Will Be There while also incorporating the essential and nice-to-have features outlined.
