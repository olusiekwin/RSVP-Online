**Strengths:**

* **Simple and user-friendly:** The core functionality of creating events, RSVPing, and managing guest lists is straightforward.
* **Flexibility for organizers:**  Organizers can control the level of detail displayed about the event and guest list.
* **Guest contribution:** The "bring something" feature is a nice touch for potlucks or other events where guests can contribute.

**Points to Consider:**

* **Security:**  Since users are registering and potentially sharing some personal information, consider implementing secure authentication and data storage practices.

* **Spam:**  Implement measures to prevent users from creating spam events or sending unsolicited emails.

* **Guest privacy:**  Guests might want control over their information being displayed (name, plus-one status).
* **Scalability:** How will the system handle a large number of events and users?
* **Integration with social media:** While social login is a nice-to-have, consider a basic email registration option for wider accessibility.

**Technical Feasibility:**

This project is definitely achievable with current web development technologies. You can explore frameworks like Django or Ruby on Rails for the backend and Javascript libraries like React or Vue.js for the frontend.

**User Experience (UX):**

* **Clear interface:** Make creating events and RSVPing intuitive and easy to follow.
* **Mobile responsiveness:** Ensure the application is accessible and user-friendly on mobile devices.
* **Notifications:** Consider sending email notifications for RSVP confirmations and event updates (optional).

**Competition:**

There are existing RSVP services like Doodle and SignUpGenius.  See how Will Be There can differentiate itself by focusing on specific user needs (e.g., congratulatory messages, "bring something" list).

**Next Steps:**

* **Prioritize features:**  Focus on building the core functionalities first (event creation, RSVP, guest list management) before implementing the nice-to-have features.
* **Develop a user flow:**  Map out the steps users will take to create events, RSVP, and manage their accounts.
* **Choose a technology stack:**  Select appropriate tools and frameworks based on your development expertise and project timeline.

I believe Will Be There has the potential to be a valuable tool for event planning. By focusing on a user-friendly experience, security, and unique features, you can create a successful RSVP service!

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Guest Registration:** While social login is convenient, consider offering traditional email and password registration as well. This caters to users who may not want to use social media for event RSVPs.
* **Notifications:**  Event organizers might want notification options for RSVPs (e.g., email, SMS).
* **Event Cancellation:**  Allow event organizers to cancel events and notify guests appropriately.
* **Customization:**  Consider options for event organizers to personalize their event pages (e.g., themes, colors).

**Nice-to-Have Features:**

* **The ability for guests to edit their RSVPs.**
* **In-app messaging for event organizers to communicate with guests.**
* **Calendar integration for guests to easily add the event to their calendars.**
