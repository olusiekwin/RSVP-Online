# The business requirements for the hackathon project are as follows:

- An online RSVP service called Will Be There, that allows registered users to create events, share the link with their friends, and have their friends indicate whether they are attending or not.
- The person organizing the event must register in order to create an event.
- The event details must include: name, date & time, location, event image (an exact square shape). Location does NOT need to be validated.

## The essential features of the application are:

- A name field for the guest, email field, whether the guest is attending or not, and whether the guest is bringing additional people.
- Only guests who have indicated that they are attending should receive the event location (and other event details) via email.
- For each event they create, the event organizer should be able to see the names of those who have RSVP'd, the names of their possible plus-ones, and the total number of confirmed guests.

### The nice-to-have features of the application are:

- Attending guests can send the organizer a congratulatory message at the time they rsvp.
- Event organizers can choose which congratulatory messages to display or hide on their event page.
- Event organizers can display or hide the guest list.
- Event organizers can display or hide the total guest count.
- Event organizers can create a list of items that guests can select and bring to the event (such as food items or drinks).
- If a guest chooses an item to bring, they can receive this info in the confirmation message, along with the Event location.
- Guests can register using Google or other social accounts.
