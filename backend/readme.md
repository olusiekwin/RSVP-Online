**Getting Started (Let's Get This Party Started!)** 

Follow these steps to get your **Will Be There** server humming:

**Prerequisites (Gotta Have the Essentials)**

Before diving in, make sure you have these tools installed:

*  **Python:** The programming language powering the server. (Download here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) 
*  **pip:** Python's package manager for installing dependencies. (Usually comes bundled with Python) 
*  **Git:** The version control system for managing your code. (Download here: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) Ô∏è

**Installation (Effortless Setup) ü™Ñ**

1. **Clone the Repository:** 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ADCH24-GROUP-22/WILL-BE-THERE.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   This isolates your project's dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # For Python 2
   python3 -m venv venv  # For Python 3
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
   source bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
   ```

5. **Install Requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This installs all the necessary libraries for your project. 

6. **Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
   These commands create and apply database changes. Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è 

7. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Now your server is up and running, ready to handle RSVP requests!
